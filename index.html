      <p>
            <p><strong>Position Title:</strong> 23-33<br>
<strong>Department:</strong> Heart & Soul<br>
<strong>Reporting To:</strong> Each Other<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> You can do work from home or can come to office (to me)</p>

<p><strong>About the Company: </strong><br>
Welcome to 23-33 Inc, a one-of-a-kind emotional startup founded with pure vibes, sarcasm, and unconditional love. We are a rapidly growing partnership firm focused on delivering joy, affection, and with inside jokes 24x7. With headquarters located wherever we are together.</p>

<p><strong>Our company takes pride in:</strong><br>
- Zero employee turnover (kisiney mujeh reject nahi kiya, ek baar onboard toh lifetime commitment)<br>
- 100% emotional return on investment<br>
- Flexible work environment (from bed cuddles to kitchen romance you can work any where)<br>
- Founder who is committed to making this the most heartwarming and fun job you'll ever sign up for<br>

  Our mission is simple: “To build a product with joy, love, laughter, 24/7 banter and with dog at our happy home.”</p>

<p><strong>About the Role:</strong><br>
We are looking for a once-in-a-lifetime candidate who is ready to accept a full-time offer — no trials, no temporary roles — in a committed, loving, and laughter-filled partnership. The candidate will be onboarded into a role that promises support, growth, respect (T&C: okkosari paruvu teeyataaniki kuda mundu vuntaadu ee employer) and unlimited cuddles.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong><br>
<b>Emotional Co-Founder:</b> I will be yours peace and tourcher and you be mine. We’ll read each other’s moods like open books and act accordingly.<br><br>
<b>Communication & Collaboration:</b> Share everything — from your day’s highlights to your reasons behind your potato face. I'll listen, hug, and support. No ghosting, no “kottesinattu” tone. Just honest, soft, jokes (of course on you) and memes.<br><br>
<b>Trust Building:</b> Trust will be a shared equity (iddaru samaana bhadhulu) — held gently. Mistakes may happen and will happen but ego-free apologies will follow (we are not in a movie to make everything look perfect but can definitely give you the main character energy).<br><br>
<b>Adventuring Partner:</b> Monthly outings, quarterly trips, and weekend drives. Worry about planning and pampering? No worries daaarlingg, it’s my department 😏 (just sit, relaxxx, give me scoldings/suggestions and you will get your research done)<br><br>
<b>Photography & PR Support:</b> Lifetime access to your personal hype man. Outfit selections (nah/haa/awwwww🫠), random dance sessions, and couple reels? Done da na done doneeee.<br><br>
<b>Growth Together:</b> Learn, unlearn, love. Build a life that feels like both of us. From emotional maturity to family planning — we’re in this as a team (based on your performance you might be promoted as a team lead).<br><br>
<b>Housekeeping (Selective):</b> Wet clothes? I’ll dry them. You? I’ll make you wet too — no reminders needed 😉</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria:</strong><br>
- Past experience in relationship management is valued (2-year internship counts 😂👀)<br>
- Must believe in long-term employment<br>
- Zero tolerance for “just seeing where it goes”<br>
- Must love weirdness, tingari-ness, and me-ness</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br>
- Free cuddles & kisses (unlimited)<br>
- Emotional safe space (24x7 availability)<br>
- Dinner plans with spicy biryani + dessert (you 😏)<br>
- Long-drive partner<br>
- Pet and baby compatible<br>
- Room for mistakes + encouragement to grow</p>

<p><strong>Work Culture:</strong><br>
✨ Equal love, shared growth<br>
🎧 Weekly jam sessions<br>
😄 Laughter-focused environment (heeheehee this was added intentionally)<br>
💬 Transparent communication (no mohamaatam near me, you can say anything even if it's about a thing I did that you didn't like)<br>
🛏️ Morning kisses, midnight talks</p>

<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong><br>
📌 This is not a contract role.<br>
📌 Once accepted, you are irreplaceable.<br>
📌 No backups, no “what-if's”.<br>
📌 This offer comes from a heart that has seen you, known you from your lows to highs.<br>
📌 There will be boarding days, stressful days, busy days, fighting days and "you are not giving me enough time" days — but never a doubtful day. It's a promise from our company's CTO (me).</p>
